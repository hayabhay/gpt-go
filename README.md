# GPT Go: Take GPT-3 everywhere you go on the web

GPT Go is a suite of free, open source Chrome extensions to bring GPT-3 everywhere you go on the web.

The first pilot is GPT-Rex, a write assistant/co-pilot for Medium.
It is fully functional and once set up, you can simply hit "Ctrl + >" to trigger an auto-complete.
Direct integrations with other blogging platforms are coming soon in addition to other editing uses cases like scientific writing using LaTeX for Overleaf etc.

Extension now available from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpt-rex-ai-assist-for-blo/occhafcmdjiieioboagohfigolecoeag).

Updates will be posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hayabhay) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhaykashyap12/).

> **Note**: This was done in collaboration with chatGPT and Github Co-pilot and all the people they learned from ðŸ˜Š
